abstract: This thesis implements and evaluates Incrementally Verifiable Computation
  (IVC) using the Plonk proof system, inspired by the Halo framework. We build
  on prior work on polynomial commitment and accumulation schemes to create
  an IVC-friendly Plonk Protocol, supporting generic elliptic curves over a
  cycle of curves, and develop an arithmetization layer with custom gates for
  elliptic curve operations, Boolean logic, and Poseidon-based hashing. \newline \newline
  Benchmarks show that the prover runs in ~300 seconds (parallel) and the
  verifier runs in ~3 seconds, with proof sizes around 10 kB. While naive
  signature verification remains faster in the short term, IVC proofs become
  more efficient in size after only 87 days, and further optimizations could
  reduce costs. These results suggest that IVC is close to practical viability
  for blockchain applications, and that optimized frameworks such as Kimchi
  or Halo2 are well-positioned for real-world deployment.
