    title = {Fiat–Shamir Transformation of Multi-Round Interactive Proofs
             (Extended Version)},
    abstract = "The celebrated Fiat–Shamir transformation turns any public-coin
                interactive proof into a non-interactive one, which inherits the
                main security properties (in the random oracle model) of the
                interactive version. While originally considered in the context
                of 3-move public-coin interactive proofs, i.e., so-called $$
                \varSigma $$-protocols, it is now applied to multi-round
                protocols as well. Unfortunately, the security loss for a $$(2\mu
                + 1)$$-move protocol is, in general, approximately $$Q^\mu $$,
                where Q is the number of oracle queries performed by the
                attacker. In general, this is the best one can hope for, as it is
                easy to see that this loss applies to the $$\mu $$-fold
                sequential repetition of $$\varSigma $$-protocols, but it raises
                the question whether certain (natural) classes of interactive
                proofs feature a milder security loss. In this work, we give
                positive and negative results on this question. On the positive
                side, we show that for $$(k_1, \ldots , k_\mu )$$-special-sound
                protocols (which cover a broad class of use cases), the knowledge
                error degrades linearly in Q, instead of $$Q^\mu $$. On the
                negative side, we show that for t-fold parallel repetitions of
                typical $$(k_1, \ldots , k_\mu )$$-special-sound protocols with
                $$t \ge \mu $$(and assuming for simplicity that t and Q are
                integer multiples of $$\mu $$), there is an attack that results
                in a security loss of approximately $$\frac{1}{2} Q^\mu /\mu ^{
                \mu +t}$$.",

                supports efficient incremental execution, cooperating analyses,
                and lattice-based reasoning. Like EqSat, egglog supports term
                rewriting, efficient congruence closure, and extraction of
                optimized terms. We identify two recent applications -- a
                unification-based pointer analysis in Datalog and an EqSat-based
                floating-point term rewriter -- that have been hampered by
                features missing from Datalog but found in EqSat or vice-versa.
                We evaluate our system by reimplementing those projects in
                egglog. The resulting systems in egglog are faster, simpler, and
                fix bugs found in the original systems. },

    abstract = "Unlike signatures in a single-party setting, threshold
                signatures require cooperation among a threshold number of
                signers each holding a share of a common private key.
                Consequently, generating signatures in a threshold setting
                imposes overhead due to network rounds among signers, proving
                costly when secret shares are stored on network-limited devices
                or when coordination occurs over unreliable networks. In this
                work, we present FROST, a Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr
                Threshold signature scheme that reduces network overhead during
                signing operations while employing a novel technique to protect
                against forgery attacks applicable to similar schemes in the
                literature. FROST improves upon the state of the art in Schnorr
                threshold signature protocols, as it can safely perform signing
                operations in a single round without limiting concurrency of
                signing operations, yet allows for true threshold signing, as
                only a threshold t out of n possible participants are required
                for signing operations, such that {\$}{\$}t{\backslash}le n{\$}{
                \$}t≤n. FROST can be used as either a two-round protocol, or
                optimized to a single-round signing protocol with a
                pre-processing stage. FROST achieves its efficiency improvements
                in part by allowing the protocol to abort in the presence of a
                misbehaving participant (who is then identified and excluded from
                future operations)---a reasonable model for practical deployment
                scenarios. We present proofs of security demonstrating that FROST
                is secure against chosen-message attacks assuming the discrete
                logarithm problem is hard and the adversary controls fewer
                participants than the threshold.",
